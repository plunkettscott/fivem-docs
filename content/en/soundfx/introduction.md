SoundFX is the successor of <a href="https://github.com/plunkettscott/interact-sound">InteractSound</a>, a FiveM resource released back in 2017 by myself. InteractSound has been downloaded over 10k times and is relied upon by a number of scripts in the FiveM community. This new iteration is a complete rewrite with an improved developer experience, improved developer tools, improved API, including spatial audio, and more.

Because this new release supersedes InteractSound, InteractSound will receive no further updates and this will be the new focus for playing non-native sounds in FiveM.
